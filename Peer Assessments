# Cristian Montes — Self Assessment

## 1. Key Contribution to the Project
I contributed significantly to organizing and completing the GitHub repository, restructuring the README, implementing the AI method and data plan, and refining the overall project documentation. I also helped finalize the slide deck and ensured that our work aligned with the project requirements.

## 2. AI Concepts or Skills Learned
I learned how NLP can be used to extract symptoms and health information from user messages, as well as how classification models categorize illnesses or medication needs. I also learned how to plan a data acquisition strategy and evaluate risks, such as bias and privacy issues. These skills will help me in future AI or machine learning courses.

## 3. Team Collaboration, Decision-making, and Ethics
Our team collaborated mostly through shared slides and GitHub. We discussed how to fairly represent user needs and avoid harmful AI outputs. We also tried to make decisions based on practicality, especially since some features or prototypes were not possible to complete within the timeframe.

## 4. What I Would Do Differently
If I had more time, I would create a working prototype or UI mockup for MediMind so the idea feels more real. I would also meet with my team earlier in the project to divide responsibilities more evenly so the final workload isn’t rushed.
