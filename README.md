# MediMind AI Project
**Virtual Health Assistant for Symptom Tracking & Wellness Suggestions**

## Overview
Our group is developing **MediMind**, a virtual health assistant that helps users describe symptoms, track medications, and receive personalized wellness suggestions.  
The project focuses on applying AI in the **Healthcare** sector to make health insights more accessible and user-friendly.

## Motivation & Market fit
- **Who the product is for**: People wanting to take control of their health, track symptoms, and manage medications more easily.
- **What needs it meets**: Simplifies preventative care, helps users organize health information, and provides lightweight AI wellness guidance.
- **Why it’s useful**: Reduces barriers to understanding symptoms, promotes healthier routines, and supports users between doctor visits.

## AI Method & Data Plan 
- **What Al/NLP methods are used**:
    - NLP to understand user messages and extract symptoms, medication info, and goals.
    - Classification models to categorize illness types, health goals, and medication needs.

- **What Data is used**:
    - Public datasets (CDC, WHO, FDA DailyMed, RXNorm)
    - Kaggle symptom datasets
    - Synthetic symptom logs and medication schedules
 
- **High-level AI process**:
    - User inputs symptoms → NLP extracts key phrases
    - Classification model predicts possible categories
    - System generates reminders, suggestions, or follow-up questions

## Ethical Considerations
- **Privacy & data protection**: Health info must be safeguarded with strict security controls.
- **Limitations & disclaimers**: MediMind is not a doctor and only provides general guidance.
- **Data bias risks**: Medical datasets may include demographic bias that affects fairness.
- **Transparency**: Users must know how AI suggestions are generated and how data is used.
