# MediMind AI Project

## Overview
Our group is developing **MediMind**, a virtual health assistant that helps users describe symptoms, track medications, and receive personalized wellness suggestions.  
The project focuses on applying AI in the **Healthcare** sector to make health insights more accessible and user-friendly.

## Brainstormed Project Ideas
Before deciding on MediMind, we explored a few potential AI applications:
1. **MediMind (Healthcare)** – AI assistant for symptom tracking and wellness advice.
2. **SafePayAI (Finance)** – Real-time AI fraud detection system for secure payments.
3. **EcoSort (Sustainability)** – Image recognition AI that improves recycling accuracy.

## Project Goals
- Develop a user-friendly virtual assistant prototype powered by AI.
- Identify ethical and technical considerations (e.g., privacy, data accuracy).
- Demonstrate collaboration using GitHub and other professional tools.

## Tools and Platforms
- **GitHub** – project hosting and collaboration  
- **Google Docs/Slides** – for drafts and presentation slides  
- **Canvas** – group communication and submissions
